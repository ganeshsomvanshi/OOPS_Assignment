    "#Q1 What are the five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python is based on several fundamental concepts that help in organizing and managing code. Here are the five key concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Classes and Objects\n",
    "Classes: A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that the created objects will have. Classes encapsulate data for the object and methods to manipulate that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Inheritance\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class. This helps in code reuse and creates a hierarchical relationship between classes. The class that is inherited from is called the base class or parent class, and the class that inherits is called the derived class or child class.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Encapsulation\n",
    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit, or class. It restricts direct access to some of the object's components, which can help prevent unintended interference and misuse. This is often achieved using private and public access modifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Abstraction\n",
    "Abstraction: Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object. This allows the user to interact with an object at a higher level without needing to understand its inner workings. In Python, abstraction can be achieved through abstract base classes and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Polymorphism\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. The most common use of polymorphism in Python is method overriding, where a method in a derived class has the same name as a method in the base class but provides a different implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of above  are as follows :\n",

    "#Q7 What is the Method Resolution Order (MRO) in Python? How can you retrieve it programmatically?\n",
    "\n",
    "'''\n",
    "The Method Resolution Order (MRO) in Python defines the order in which base classes are searched when executing a method. It is particularly relevant in the context of multiple inheritance, where a class inherits from more than one base class, and there can be ambiguity in which method should be called.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding Method Resolution Order (MRO)\n",
    "**1. Purpose of MRO:\n",
    "\n",
    "The MRO determines the order in which base classes are searched for a method or attribute.\n",
    "It ensures a consistent and predictable way of method resolution in complex inheritance hierarchies.\n",
    "**2. C3 Linearization:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses an algorithm called C3 linearization (or C3 superclass linearization) to determine the MRO. This algorithm combines the linearizations of the base classes while preserving the order in which the base classes are listed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The C3 linearization is used to resolve method calls in a way that respects the inheritance hierarchy and method resolution rules. It ensures that the method resolution respects the order in which base classes are defined and avoids ambiguity.\n",
